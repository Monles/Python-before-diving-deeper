## About The Project

There are many notes are really helpful for reviewing concepts of python. Teaching & sharing aslo helps me to learn more.

Here's what you can do:
* Fork or download the project, and run them.
* You should research for the concepts you want to understand further.
* Contact me if there is any error occuring.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
